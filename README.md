# LambdaForge - AWS Infrastructure Automation Platform

![LambdaForge Logo](https://img.shields.io/badge/LambdaForge-AWS%20Infrastructure%20Automation-orange?style=for-the-badge&logo=aws-lambda)

LambdaForge is an intelligent AWS infrastructure provisioning platform that uses AWS Lambda as the core orchestration engine. Users describe their application needs through a beautiful web interface, and Lambda functions automatically design, provision, and manage the optimal AWS architecture.

## üöÄ Core Features

### 1. Intelligent Infrastructure Design
- **Lambda Function**: `infrastructure-analyzer`
- AI-powered architecture recommendations based on requirements
- Uses ML to suggest best practices and cost-effective solutions
- Input: Application requirements (traffic, data needs, compliance, budget)
- Output: Optimized AWS architecture recommendations

### 2. Automated Resource Provisioning
- **Lambda Function**: `resource-provisioner`
- Directly creates AWS resources using AWS SDKs
- Handles dependency ordering (VPC ‚Üí Subnets ‚Üí Security Groups ‚Üí EC2/RDS)
- Implements retry logic and error handling
- Tracks provisioning status in DynamoDB

### 3. Real-time Cost Optimization
- **Lambda Function**: `cost-optimizer`
- EventBridge scheduled trigger (daily)
- Analyzes resource utilization via CloudWatch
- Automatically right-sizes instances
- Suggests and implements cost-saving measures

### 4. Infrastructure Health Monitoring
- **Lambda Function**: `health-monitor`
- CloudWatch Events trigger on resource state changes
- Auto-healing capabilities (restart failed instances, scale on demand)
- Sends alerts via SNS when manual intervention needed

### 5. Environment Management
- **Lambda Functions**: `environment-cloner`, `environment-destroyer`
- Clone production to staging with one click
- Safely tear down development environments
- Manage environment lifecycle

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **React** web application with modern UI/UX
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling with custom orange theme
- **Multi-step wizard** interface matching AWS design patterns
- Real-time updates via WebSocket (API Gateway WebSocket)
- Hosted on S3 + CloudFront (when deployed)

### Backend Services (Future Implementation)
- **API Gateway**: REST endpoints + WebSocket for real-time updates
- **Lambda Functions**: 8-10 specialized functions handling different aspects
- **DynamoDB**: Store infrastructure state, user projects, deployment history
- **S3**: Architecture diagrams, logs, backup configurations
- **EventBridge**: Orchestrate complex workflows between Lambda functions
- **Step Functions**: Handle multi-step provisioning workflows
- **SNS**: Notifications and alerts
- **CloudWatch**: Monitoring and logging

### Key Lambda Functions
1. `api-handler` - Process web requests
2. `infrastructure-analyzer` - AI-powered architecture design
3. `resource-provisioner` - Create AWS resources
4. `dependency-resolver` - Handle resource dependencies
5. `cost-optimizer` - Continuous cost optimization
6. `health-monitor` - Infrastructure monitoring
7. `environment-manager` - Manage dev/staging/prod environments
8. `notification-handler` - Send alerts and updates

## üéØ User Journey

### 1. Project Setup
- User describes application (web app, API, data processing, etc.)
- Specifies requirements (expected traffic, data size, compliance needs)
- Sets budget constraints

### 2. Architecture Design
- Lambda analyzes requirements
- Generates multiple architecture options with cost estimates
- User selects preferred option or requests modifications

### 3. Automated Provisioning
- Lambda orchestrates resource creation
- Real-time progress updates via WebSocket
- Handles errors and retries automatically

### 4. Ongoing Management
- Continuous monitoring and optimization
- Automated scaling and cost management
- Health checks and auto-healing

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- AWS Account (for future deployment)

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd lambdaforge

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Build for Production
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build
```

## üìã Configuration Steps

The application guides users through 9 configuration steps:

1. **AWS Required** - AWS credentials and basic project setup
2. **Infrastructure** - Select storage services (S3, DynamoDB, RDS, EBS, EFS)
3. **Compute** - Choose compute services (Lambda, EC2, ECS, Fargate)
4. **Integration** - API Gateway, EventBridge, SNS, Step Functions
5. **Security** - IAM roles, Security Groups, KMS, Secrets Manager
6. **Monitoring** - CloudWatch, X-Ray, CloudTrail, Alarms
7. **Deployment** - CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CloudFormation
8. **Optimization** - AI-powered cost and performance optimization
9. **Generate** - Review and deploy infrastructure

## üé® Design Features

- **Orange Theme**: Custom color palette matching AWS design patterns
- **Multi-step Wizard**: Progress indicator with completed/active states
- **Service Cards**: Interactive selection with Lambda integration details
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Real-time Feedback**: Status updates and validation messages
- **Professional UI**: Clean, modern interface inspired by AWS Console

## üîß Technologies Used
